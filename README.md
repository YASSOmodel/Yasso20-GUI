#### How To Run It?

To run it, in the terminal you need to go to the yasso folder and run the run_yasso.sh script to bypass the 
launch of "dangerous/unknown" files (libraries).
To do this, use the command: 

> ./run_yasso.sh

Then just open yasso.

The first run can be long, due to the fact that all libraries are loaded. Next launch is very fast.
